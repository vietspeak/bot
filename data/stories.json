In her sleep the Country Mouse dreamed she was a Town Mouse with all the luxuries and delights of city life that her friend had described for her. So the next day when the Town Mouse asked the Country Mouse to go home with her to the city, she gladly said yes.  When they reached the mansion in which the Town Mouse lived, they found on the table in the dining room the leavings of a very fine banquet.
